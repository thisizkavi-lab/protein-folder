DeepMind-inspired Protein Folder (Real Data Implementation)
A PyTorch implementation of a simplified transformer architecture for sequence-to-structure prediction. This project utilizes real experimental data from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB) to train a model that predicts residue-residue contact maps from amino acid sequences.

🧬 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for bioinformatics:

Data Acquisition: Fetches high-resolution X-ray crystallography structures.
Preprocessing: Cleans structures (removing solvents/ions), extracts C-alpha backbone coordinates, and computes real physical distance matrices.
Model Training: A Transformer encoder learns to map amino acid sequences to residue-residue contact maps.
Visualization: Compares model predictions against experimentally verified physical contacts.
🚀 Key Features
Real-World Data: Trained on actual protein structures (e.g., 1CRN).
Physics-Based Labels: Ground truth is generated from atomic Euclidean distances (<8 Angstroms threshold).
Self-Attention Mechanism: Leverages multi-head attention to capture long-range interactions in protein folding.
Fallback Mechanism: Includes a robust local backup mode to ensure the pipeline runs even if external downloads are blocked.
📦 Installation
This project requires standard ML libraries and Biopython for structure parsing.

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/protein-folder.gitcd protein-folderpip install -r requirements.txt
🏃 Usage
The training script automatically fetches the required PDB files (or uses local backup), processes them, and trains the model.

bash

python train.py
Workflow:

Connects to RCSB PDB.
Downloads and parses .pdb files.
Extracts sequence and C-alpha geometry.
Trains the Transformer for 200 epochs.
Outputs real_protein_result.png showing the Ground Truth vs. Prediction.
🧠 Model Architecture
The architecture consists of three main components:

Embedding Layer: Projects discrete amino acid tokens (20 standard AAs) into a 64-dimensional continuous vector space.
Positional Encoding: Injects sequence order using sinusoidal functions.
Transformer Encoder (4 Layers): Utilizes multi-head self-attention to allow the model to weigh the importance of different amino acids relative to each other.
Interaction Head: Computes outer products of residue embeddings to predict contact probabilities.
📊 Results
The model successfully learns to predict structural contacts from raw sequence data.
